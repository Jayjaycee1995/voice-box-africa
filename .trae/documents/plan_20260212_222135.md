I will proceed with a complete manual setup of the Laravel backend, ensuring compatibility with your PHP 8.0 environment (using Laravel 9).

### **Phase 1: Clean Installation & Setup**
1.  **Clean Up**: Remove the previous partial/failed backend folders.
2.  **Install Laravel 9**: Use Composer to install Laravel 9 (compatible with your PHP 8.0) with the `--no-dev` flag to avoid the previous permission issues with development tools.
    *   Command: `composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-backend "9.*" --prefer-dist --no-dev`
3.  **Environment Config**: Configure `.env` to connect to your XAMPP MySQL database (`voice_box_africa`).

### **Phase 2: Database Architecture (Migrations)**
I will create the following database tables:
1.  **`users`**: Extended with `role` (client/talent), `bio`, `skills`, `profile_image`.
2.  **`gigs`**: Title, description, budget, deadline, status (open/assigned/completed).
3.  **`proposals`**: Linked to Gigs and Artists, with bid amount and cover letter.
4.  **`invitations`**: For the "Direct Invite" feature.
5.  **`messages`**: For the chat system.

### **Phase 3: Backend Implementation (API)**
I will generate the Models, Controllers, and Routes:
1.  **Authentication**: Setup **Laravel Sanctum** for secure API token authentication (Login/Register).
2.  **Gig Management**: APIs to Post, List, and View Gigs.
3.  **Proposals**: APIs for Artists to submit proposals and Clients to view/accept them.
4.  **Messaging**: API for the chat system.
5.  **Admin**: Basic admin endpoints.

### **Phase 4: Verification**
1.  Run the server (`php artisan serve`).
2.  Test the API health endpoint.

I will handle all file creations and command executions. You will only need to ensure your XAMPP MySQL server is running.
